<h1>Blobs</h1>
Blobs is a turn based strategy game.

<h2>Goal</h2>
To destroy all enemy blobs.

<h2>Turn</h2>
A turn consists of:
<ul>
<li>Choosing some actions for your blobs. These will appear in the queue on the right.</li>
<li>Clicking done which will cause those moves to be carried out.</li>
<li>Blobs growing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Moves</h2>
To do something with a blob you must first select it by clicking on it. You can
then order it to move by clicking somewhere else on the board, or use one of
its abilities by clicking the button in the control panel on the right.
<p>As you enqueue moves, you will notice your action points (shown on the top 
right) decreasing. Your action points limit what you can do on a turn. 
Different moves use different amounts of action points. Additionally, the 
same move can use different amounts of action points depending on the size 
of the blob making the move.</p>
<p>You can see how many action points a move of a blob will take by selecting
a blob and right clicking on the intended destination.</p>
 
<h2>Units</h2>
You have a few different types of blobs which can do different things:
<ul>
<li>Push Blobs - when activated, push nearby blobs</li>
<li>Pull Blobs - when activated, pull nearby blobs</li>
<li>Exploding Blobs - when activated, explode, creating a hole in the board 
which blobs can fall into</li>
<li>Death Ray Blobs - when activated, shoots out a ray in one direction which 
kills any blobs it touches</li>
<li>Slick Blobs - when activated, creates a slippery region on the board</li>
</ul>
All blobs also have the ability to split into two smaller blobs. They must be 
big enough to do so. All blobs can also fill in holes on the board.

<h2>Board</h2>
The board can have some special areas on it:
<ul>
<li>Holes - When blobs move onto or across a hole, they fall through it and 
die. They also die if they fall off the edge of the board.</li>
<li>Anchor Points - When a blob is over an anchor point, it can not be moved 
by a blob force.</li>
<li>Energy Points - When a blob is over an energy point, that player gets an 
increased number of action points on future turns.</li> 
</ul>
