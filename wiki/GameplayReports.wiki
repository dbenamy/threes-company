#summary What games everyone is going to play.

= Introduction =

We need to play a total of ten games, one from each of ten categories, and do a writeup of its merits (roughly 3 graf).

I'm wikifying these names, so when we do writeups they'll link right over.

*Update:* The ones that are ~~stricken through~~ are no longer on the list, for some reason.
