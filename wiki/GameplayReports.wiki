#summary What games everyone is going to play.

= Introduction =

We need to play a total of ten games, one from each of ten categories, and do a writeup of its merits (roughly 3 graf).

I'm wikifying these names, so when we do writeups they'll link right over.

*Update:* The ones that are ~~stricken through~~ are no longer on the list, for some reason.

_@Eugene, where did you see this?  When I open up http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cs4995/4995-RecommendedGames.doc it's all the same games.  Am I looking at wrong list? :o/ -- John_

_The list I looked at is linked from the class page:  http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/~cs4995/files/Recommended_Games_Final_Fall_07.pdf --Eugene_
