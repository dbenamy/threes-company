#summary Blobs Concept document - work in progress

= Blobs Concept Doc =

== Intro ==
Blobs is a turn based strategy game played on a 2D board. 2 players start at opposite ends of the board, each armed with: 2 push blobs; 2 pull blobs; one explosion blob; one death ray blob; fully charged Activity Point meters. On their turn, a player can move or turn a blob, split a blob, or use a blob's ability, with each action drawing Activity Points (AP) from their available Activity Point pool.  The amount of points used per action is prorated by a number of factors and are accrue after each turn.  A player's turn is finished when the player has spent all their AP on blob actions or optionally selects Done to carry the remaining AP into their next turn.  Players try to kill each others' blobs using a variety of tactics discussed in further detail below.  A player wins when they have destroyed all enemy blobs.

_EK: How far can a blob move per turn?  Does a blob's speed play a part?_
_JM: I think we can discuss the specifics in the units section and leave the intro high-level._

== The Board ==
The board is a square with each side being 20 times the diameter of a starting blob. It does not have any grid visible to the players. The resolution of the board will be granular such that it will seem to players that they can move within a full 360 degree range of motion.  Blobs whose center crosses any edge of the board fall to their doom.  Players may interact with the board by creating holes into which enemy blobs may be pushed or pulled.  The board can have features on it as well, such as anchor points (discussed below).

~~_EK: What is moving off the edge - touching the edge, more than half the blob is outside, all of it?_~~
_EK: How about holes decreasing in size each turn (perhaps the same rate as blobs increase?_

== Units ==
Blobs have a size and grow slightly each turn until they reach a maximum size of 3 times the starting diameter.  Blobs may also be split provided the halved size is greater than half the starting diameter.  In general, however, each child blob is half the size of the parent blob.  When two blobs from opposing teams touch, the larger destroys the smaller. 

There are a few kinds of blobs:
 * Pusher blobs
 * Puller blobs
 * Death ray blobs
 * Exploding blobs

When pusher or puller blobs activate their forces, there is a physical force exerted on itself and other blobs within a certain radius. For example, if a pusher blob is next to another blob and activates its force, both blobs will be pushed apart from each other. If a blob is on an anchor point, it can't be moved by a blob force, but can still affect other blobs. Blob forces can be used to sling blobs across the board, suck in weak enemy blobs, keep blobs out of an area, etc.

_EK:  Do forces decrease gradually with range, or just terminate abruptly after a certain range?_

A death ray blob can only use its ability if it hasn't moved in 9 turns. When a death ray blob is activated, it emits death rays in 4 directions- forwards, backwards, left, and right where forwards is the direction it last moved in or was turned to. Any blob on either team that is touched by a death ray is killed.

_EK: Death ray range idea - perhaps bigger blobs with death ray ability can shoot it farther?_

An exploding blob destroys itself, creating a hole in the board that's the size of the blob. Any other blob that falls into the hole dies. If the board is split into more than one pieces and there are blobs on more than one piece, the player that split the board looses.

== Strategy ==
Want to use big blobs for greater killing power vs want to use many blobs for abilities.
...

_EK: I don't see a clear use for smaller blobs yet... perhaps quick death-ray carriers (if we decide that smaller blobs move faster)?  Quick anchor point capturers?  How to defend against a small blob death-ray rush?  Or, how to defend against a huge death-ray blob that is too big for a trap hole and hard to push around in general due to its size? _

== One Minute of Gameplay ==

  * Players each start with 2 push blobs, 2 pull blobs, one explosion and one death ray blob; we'll call our players Blue and Red.
  * Turns move fairly quickly. Blue starts by setting his death ray blob in motion toward Red's pieces.
  * Red reacts by moving forward his exploding blob and both puller blobs.
  * Blue decides to focus on death ray production, splitting his death ray in half.
  * Red thinks about going for a explode-and-pull strategy; he splits his exploding blob to have a spare, and positions and advances his pullers behind one exploding blob.
  * Blue sees what's happening and, anticipating being sucked into a hole next turn, activates his 2 pushes to repel the incoming threat.  He also activates his death ray on one of Red's pullers, effectively cutting their sucking power in half.
  * ...

_JM: I'm starting to wonder about this minute of gameplay.. it seems like you could take Red and Blue's internal thoughts pretty far.  Like, each bullet could be 4 sentences about current positioning, player choices, their intentions, and then consequences-- kind of directly like Bernie was looking for?_

== Platform ==
Blobs will be a PC game that runs on at least Windows and Linux. If we decide to write it in Java, it should be playable on any J2SE platform.

== Points of Differentiation ==
We don't know of any game like this. It's different than traditional strategy games like Chess and Checkers in that it involves physics simulations so you can't really plan a few moves ahead with precision and it will depend more on intuition and experience.

== Inspirational Sources ==
Elements of Blobs are inspired by a number of games. The turn based strategy play is inspired by Chess, the use of "physical" bodies interacting is from Pool, and the other interesting abilities and visual style is from Worms.

== Target Audience ==
?
_EK: I would say everyone... 8 to 80 years old?_

== Competitive Products ==
_EK: Worms is a good comparable game, actually_

== Visual Style ==
Blobs is about thinking with abstract shapes and forces. There's nothing about it that needs to look realistic. It will have a simple and cartoony look and feel. Although the game is turn-based, we'd like to give a sense of motion and the forces involved, which we'll reflect with passive arrows and simple animated blobs. Simplicity is important, since ever-multiplying pieces will otherwise complicate the field of view.
