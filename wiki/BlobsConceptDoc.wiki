Blobs is a turn based strategy game played on a 2D board. 2 players start at opposite ends of the board with a pusher and puller blob each. On their turn, a player can move a blob, split a blob, or activate or deactivate blobs' forces (pushing or pulling). Players try to consume each others' blobs. When a player runs out of blobs, they loose.

Blobs have a size. Every blob grows slightly each turn. When two blobs (from different teams) touch, the larger consumes and destroys the smaller. When blobs split, each child blob is half the size.

When a blob activates its force, there is a physics forces type interaction (like gravity) between it and other blobs within a certain radius. For example, if a pusher blob is next to another blob and activates its force, both blobs will be pushed apart from each other. There will be anchor points in a few places on the board. Any blob on an anchor point can't be moved by a blob force, but can still affect other blobs.

Blob forces can be used to sling blobs across the board, suck in weak enemy blobs, defend an area, etc.

Platform: PC possibly with Java installed

Points of Differentiation: We don't know of any game like this. It's different than traditional strategy games like Chess and Checkers in that it involves physics simulations so you can't really plan a few moves ahead and it will depend more on intuition and experience.
