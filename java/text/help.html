<h1>Blobs</h1>
Blobs is a turn based strategy game.

<h2>Goal</h2>
To destroy all enemy blobs.

<h2>Turn</h2>
A turn consists of:
<ul>
<li>Choosing some actions for your blobs. These will appear in the queue on the right.</li>
<li>Clicking done which will cause those moves to be carried out.</li>
<li>Blobs growing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Attacking</h2>
When two blobs collide (touch each other) both take damage. If they are similar 
in size they will both die. If one is significantly bigger than the other, 
the small one will die and the big one will take damage and shrink. So if you're
trying to kill an enemy blob, you need a blob at least as big as it or a few
smaller blobs.
<p>Blobs take damage from opponent and friendly blobs. Also keep in mind that if
blobs are near each other and grow, they may grow into each other and collide.
</p>

<h2>Moves</h2>
To do something with a blob you must first select it by clicking on it. You can
then order it to move by <b>right</b> clicking somewhere else on the board, or use one of
its abilities by clicking the button in the control panel on the right.
<p>As you enqueue moves, you will notice your action points (shown on the top 
right) decreasing. Your action points limit what you can do on a turn. 
Different moves use different amounts of action points. Additionally, the 
same move can use different amounts of action points depending on the size 
of the blob making the move.</p>
<p>When you select a blob and move the mouse around, the number next to the 
cursor tells you how many action points it will take to move there.</p>
<p>If you seem to be missing action points or would like to undo the moves 
you've selected, click the clear queue button. This will remove all the moves
you selected and restore all of your action points. Then you can start over.</p>
 
<h2>Units</h2>
You have a few different types of blobs which can do different things:
<ul>
<li>Push Blobs - when activated, push nearby blobs</li>
<li>Pull Blobs - when activated, pull nearby blobs</li>
<li>Exploding Blobs - when activated, explode, creating a hole in the board 
which blobs can fall into</li>
<li>Death Ray Blobs - when activated, shoots out a ray in one direction which 
kills any blobs it touches</li>
<li>Slick Blobs - when activated, creates a slippery region on the board</li>
</ul>
All blobs also have the ability to split into two smaller blobs. They must be 
big enough to do so. All blobs can also fill in holes on the board.
<p>When you select a blob, its type is shown above the ability controls.</p>

<h2>Board</h2>
The board can have some special areas on it:
<ul>
<li>Anchor Points (in the middle on top) - When a blob is over an 
anchor point, it can not be moved by a blob force.</li>
<li>Holes (the board starts with one in the middle) - 
When blobs move onto or across a hole, they fall through it and 
die. They also die if they fall off the edge of the board. Explosion blobs can
create new holes and all blobs can fill existing ones.</li>
<li>Energy Points (in the middle on the bottom) - 
When a blob is over an energy point, that player gets an 
increased number of action points on future turns.</li> 
</ul>
